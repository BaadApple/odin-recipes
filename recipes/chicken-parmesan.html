    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this<br>
        delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <p>In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have<br>
        with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and<br>
        cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with<br>
        this method.</p>
    <p>Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to<br>
        great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top,<br>
        so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can<br>
        always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most<br>
        versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella,<br>
        tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.</p>
    <p>Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of<br>
        flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them<br>
        to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
