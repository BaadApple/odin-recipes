    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before<br>
        they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can<br>
        substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred.<br>
