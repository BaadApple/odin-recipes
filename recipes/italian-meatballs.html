    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before<br>
        they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can<br>
        substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned<br>
            translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender,<br>
            about 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl (do not overmix). Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs,<br>
            parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat<br>
            mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
